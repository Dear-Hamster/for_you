## 💖 Pookie Website - A Web Project from the Heart

The **Pookie Website** is a simple but meaningful web project I built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 

This wasn’t just any random coding practice. This site had a real purpose:  
To say **“I’m sorry”** and **make my special someone smile** again. 🥺❤️

I designed the site with love, adding cute visuals, sweet messages, and a touch of personality — just like I would in a handwritten letter, but modern and interactive.

| Technology | Description                      |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| HTML       | Structure of the web (the bones) |
| CSS        | Style and layout (the vibes)     |
| JavaScript | Logic and interaction (the brain)|


### 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to turn emotions into code (fr, this taught me that dev work can be deeply personal)
- Improved my front-end skills while working on something that mattered emotionally
- Gained confidence in expressing myself through web design

### 🌟 Why It Matters:
Sometimes tech isn't about building the next startup —  
Sometimes it's about using your skills to connect, to communicate, and to show someone you care in your own creative way.  
This site is my way of saying: **"I messed up, but I care enough to code for you."**
